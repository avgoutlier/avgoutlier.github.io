## Organizing business requirements

Let's take a look at an example of building a business environment with a simple structure.

- Data - Member ID, name
- Functionality - Member registration and viewing
- DB - not yet selected

Assuming the above situation, let's take a look at an overview of the environment we'll be building. 

{% include aligner.html images="posts/post_2/1.png" column=1 %}

This is a typical web application hierarchy. And since we don't have a set DB, let's create a repository as an interface and create a class called MemoryMemberRepository to use it. 

{% include aligner.html images="posts/post_2/2.png" column=1 %}

Let's go through a development example where we'll create a simple memory-based repository to get started.

## Create a member domain and repository

First, create a package called .domain and create a Member class.

```java
package hello.hellospring.domain;

public class Member {
 
   private Long id;
   private String name;
   public Long getId() {
   return id;
   
 }
 
 public void setId(Long id) {
 
   this.id = id;
   
 }
 
 public String getName() {
 
   return name;
 
 }
 
 public void setName(String name) {
 
   this.name = name;
 
 }
}
```

As shown above, we've created a member object to hold our business requirements. Next, we'll create a .repository package and inside it, we'll create an interface called MemberRepository.

```java
package hello.hellospring.repository;

import hello.hellospring.domain.Member;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public interface MemberRepository {

   Member save(Member member);
   Optional<Member> findById(Long id);
   Optional<Member> findByName(String name);
   List<Member> findAll();
 
}
```

An interface like the one above will be responsible for three functions:

1. Store member information in a repository
2. Find the member ID and name
3. Find the returned list

In the code above, the Optional is there to ensure that if the function that finds the ID and name returns a null value, it will be wrapped in an Optional and returned. Next, we'll create a class called MemoryMemberRepository.

```java
package hello.hellospring.repository;

import hello.hellospring.domain.Member;
import java.util.*;
 
public class MemoryMemberRepository implements MemberRepository {

   private static Map<Long, Member> store = new HashMap<>();
   private static long sequence = 0L;
   
   @Override
   public Member save(Member member) {
 
     member.setId(++sequence);
     store.put(member.getId(), member);
     return member;
 
   }
 
   @Override
   public Optional<Member> findById(Long id) {
 
     return Optional.ofNullable(store.get(id));
 
   }
 
   @Override
   public List<Member> findAll() {
 
     return new ArrayList<>(store.values());
 
   }
   
   @Override
   public Optional<Member> findByName(String name) {
 
     return store.values().stream().filter(member -> member.getName().equals(name)).findAny();
 
   }
   
   public void clearStore() {
 
     store.clear();
 
   }
}
```

With code like the above, you can store member information in your store. However, due to concurrency issues, we recommend using ConcurrentHashMap or AtomicLong instead of HashMap in more complex cases.

## Writing member repository test cases

A common practice is to write test cases to check the application after it's developed. This is because simply running the main file can be inefficient when you have a large application to test. In Java, we typically use a framework called JUnit to write test cases. To create a test case for our MemberRepository, we'll create a MemberRepositoryTest inside our test package.

```java
package hello.hellospring.repository;

import hello.hellospring.domain.Member;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;

class MemoryMemberRepositoryTest {

   MemoryMemberRepository repository = new MemoryMemberRepository();
   
   @AfterEach
   public void afterEach() {
   
     repository.clearStore();
     
   }
   
   @Test
   public void save() {
   
     //given
     Member member = new Member();
     member.setName("spring");
     
     //when
     repository.save(member);
     
     //then
     Member result = repository.findById(member.getId()).get();
     assertThat(result).isEqualTo(member);
     
   }
   
   @Test
   public void findByName() {
   
     //given
     Member member1 = new Member();
     member1.setName("spring1");
     repository.save(member1);
     Member member2 = new Member();
     member2.setName("spring2");
     repository.save(member2);
     
     //when
     Member result = repository.findByName("spring1").get();
     
     //then
     assertThat(result).isEqualTo(member1);
     
   }
   
   @Test
   public void findAll() {
   
     //given
     Member member1 = new Member();
     member1.setName("spring1");
     repository.save(member1);
     
     Member member2 = new Member();
     member2.setName("spring2");
     repository.save(member2);
 
     //when
     List<Member> result = repository.findAll();
 
     //then
     assertThat(result.size()).isEqualTo(2);
     
   }
 
}
```

The reason for @AfterEach is to remove memory after each test, as the results remain in the DB after each test and can affect other tests. It's also a good idea to make sure that your tests are independent. In other words, you should avoid having dependencies between tests.

## Developing member services

Let's create a service to implement our business logic. First, we'll create a service package and create a MemberService class inside it.

```java
package hello.hellospring.service;

import hello.hellospring.domain.Member;
import hello.hellospring.repository.MemberRepository;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class MemberService {

   private final MemberRepository memberRepository = new MemoryMemberRepository();
   public Long join(Member member) {
   
     validateDuplicateMember(member); // Validate duplicate members
     memberRepository.save(member);
     return member.getId();
     
   }
   
   private void validateDuplicateMember(Member member) {
   
     memberRepository.findByName(member.getName()).ifPresent(m -> {throw new IllegalStateException("The member already exists.");});
 
   }
 
   public List<Member> findMembers() {
   
     return memberRepository.findAll();
     
   }
   
   public Optional<Member> findOne(Long memberId) {
   
     return memberRepository.findById(memberId);
     
   }
   
}
```

For further learning, we added logic to reject members with duplicate names.

## Writing member service test code

Let's create test code for the member service class. You can create them directly in the test package, as you would for a repository test, but you can also create them in the service class with IntelliJ shortcuts: ctrl + shift + T on Windows (cmd + shift + T on Mac).

{% include aligner.html images="posts/post_2/3.png" column=1 %}

You can use the shortcut to automatically generate a template for your test code. Let's write some test code.

```java
package hello.hellospring.service;

import hello.hellospring.domain.Member;
import hello.hellospring.repository.MemoryMemberRepository;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class MemberServiceTest {

   MemberService memberService;
   MemoryMemberRepository memberRepository;
 
   @BeforeEach
   public void beforeEach() {
 
     memberRepository = new MemoryMemberRepository();
     memberService = new MemberService(memberRepository);
 
   }
 
   @AfterEach
   public void afterEach() {
 
     memberRepository.clearStore();
 
   }
   
   @Test
   public void signup() throws Exception {
 
     //Given
     Member member = new Member();
     member.setName("hello");
 
     //When
     Long saveId = memberService.join(member);
 
     //Then
     Member findMember = memberRepository.findById(saveId).get();
     assertEquals(member.getName(), findMember.getName());
 
   }
 
   @Test
   public void duplicate_member_exception() throws Exception {
 
     //Given
     Member member1 = new Member();
     member1.setName("spring");
     Member member2 = new Member();
     member2.setName("spring");
 
     //When
     memberService.join(member1);
     IllegalStateException e = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class,() -> memberService.join(member2)); // An exception should be thrown
     assertThat(e.getMessage()).isEqualTo("The member already exists.");
 
   }
   
}
```

Let's take a look at @BeforeEach in the code above.

```java
   MemberService memberService;
   MemoryMemberRepository memberRepository; // (2) inject the created object into memberRepository
 
   @BeforeEach
   public void beforeEach() {
 
     memberRepository = new MemoryMemberRepository(); // (1) create MemoryMemberRepository
     memberService = new MemberService(memberRepository); // (3) inject memberRepository into MemberService
 
   }
```

The @BeforeEach is the code we run before each test is executed. We add this to maintain the independence of our test units. Since each test contains a setName method, we need to initialize the repository, so we add the code above. That's the most basic way to develop test code.
