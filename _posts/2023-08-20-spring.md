## Add a home screen

This time, we're going to create the home screen, which is the first thing you see when you land on the page. First, create a HomeController and then add the following code to it.

```java
package hello.hellospring.controller;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "home";
    }
}
```

It simply returns a static file called home. Next, let's create the home file returned by the Controller. Create a home.html file in your template and then add the code below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<body>
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h1>Hello Spring</h1>
        <p>Member Features</p>
        <p>
            <a href="/members/new">Sign up</a>
            <a href="/members">Member List</a>
        </p>
    </div>
</div> <!-- /container -->
</body>
</html>
```

Let's get this far, then run our main app and connect to localhost:8080.



You should see a home screen like the one above. The home.html file doesn't have any detailed functionality implemented, so signups and lists will get a blank page. So let's go ahead and implement that functionality.

## Registration

First, let's create the signup functionality. In the MemberController we created earlier, we'll add the following code.

```java
@GetMapping("/members/new")
public String createForm() {
    return "members/createMemberForm";
}
```

In the html file that implements the home screen, we'll create a function called members/new, which will return the members/createMemberForm file when someone comes in as a member. Next, we'll create a members subdirectory in templates and write that file there.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<body>
<div class="container">
  <form action="/members/new" method="post">
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="name">name</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
    </div>
    <button type="submit">register</button>
  </form>
</div> <!-- /container -->
</body>
</html>
```

Let's finish the implementation up to this point and run the main app.
